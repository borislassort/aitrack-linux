<p align="center"> - The open head tracker - </p>

## What is this?

### This is a Linux port of AITrack
AITrack is a 6-Degree of Freedom headtracker designed to work alongside [Opentrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack) for its use in simulators/games. 

AITrack uses its own tracking pipeline (based on neural networks) to estimate the user's head position with respect to the webcam and then, streams it to Opentrack, which in turn, transmits it to your games.

### Main features

* Hardware (IR LEDs, specific hardware...) free headtracking solution.
* Good performance under poor light conditions.
* Good detection with partial face occlusion (using glasses).
* Reasonable low CPU percentage consumption.
* Remote-running capability. You can use a second PC (for example, a laptop)to stream the tracking data to your main machine.

## Dependencies
Here are listed the build and runtime dependencies and their repective versions:

### Dependencies used originally on Artix:
- `qt5-base 5.15.2+kde+r210-1`

- `opencv 4.5.3-2`
- `spdlog 1.9.0-1`
- `fmt 8.0.1-1`
- `openmp 12.0.1-1`
- `vtk 8.2.0-20`

#### Full command:
`sudo pacman -S qt5-base qt5-x11extras opencv spdlog fmt openmp vtk`

### List of Ubuntu packages that could potentially resolve them:
- `qtbase5-dev`
- `qtbase5-dev-tools`
- `libqt5x11extras5-dev`
- `libopencv-dev`
- `libspdlog-dev`
- `libfmt-dev`
- `libomp-12-dev`
- `qt5-default`
- `libqt5x11extras5`
- `libspdlog1`
- `libomp5-12`
- `libxsettings-dev`
- `libxsettings-client-dev`

#### Full command:
`sudo apt install qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools libqt5x11extras5-dev libopencv-dev libspdlog-dev libfmt-dev libomp-12-dev qt5-default libqt5x11extras5 libspdlog1 libomp5-12 libxsettings-dev libxsettings-client-dev`

## Installing and running

### For Arch-based systems:
1. You can install this port via its [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/mdk97/aitrack-linux-pkgbuild)
2. Install the `opentrack` package from the AUR.
3. Run Opentrack and make sure to select Input = **UDP over network**, then, click "Start". Opentrack then will be listening for the data AITrack will send.
5. Run `aitrack` and click "Start tracking". 
6. Look around!

### For Ubuntu-based systems:

1. Download onnxruntime: `curl -L https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/download/v1.4.0/onnxruntime-linux-x64-1.4.0.tgz --output onnxruntime-linux-x64-1.4.0.tgz`.
2. Extract the archive: `gunzip onnxruntime-linux-x64-1.4.0.tgz && tar --extract -f onnxruntime-linux-x64-1.4.0.tar`.
3. Generate the Makefile: `qmake -makefile`.
4. Build the project: `make`.
5. Create the directory where the models will be searched: `sudo mkdir /usr/share/aitrack && sudo mkdir /usr/share/aitrack/models`.
6. Copy all the model files into the newly created directory: `sudo cp models/* /usr/share/aitrack/models/`.
7. Copy the shared object file `libonnxruntime.so.1.4.0` into the `/usr/lib/` directory: `sudo cp onnxruntime-linux-x64-1.4.0/lib/libonnxruntime.so.1.4.0 /usr/lib/`.
8. Install OpenTrack the preferred way for your distro.
9. Run Opentrack and make sure to select Input = **UDP over network**, then, click "Start". Opentrack then will be listening for the data AITrack will send.
10. Run `./aitrack` and click "Start tracking".
11. Look around!

### But... I don't have a webcam :(

No problem. This program supports [Droid Cam](https://www.dev47apps.com/), so you're able to use your smartphone as a camera.

### My webcam is too old

Don't worry. AITrack supports low resolutions pretty well. Anything achieving at least 30fps and 480p will do the job fine.
